The provided code snippet is written in CSS, not a programming language like JavaScript or Python. It sets the `flex-direction` property to `column`. 

If you are experiencing issues or bugs with this code, it is important to provide more context about what you are trying to achieve and the specific problem you are facing. Without additional information, it is difficult to identify any potential bugs or suggest specific repairs.

However, here are some general suggestions:

1. Check for typos: Make sure that the property name (`flex-direction`) is spelled correctly and that there are no extra characters or spaces.
2. Check compatibility: Verify that the browser or rendering engine you are using supports the flexbox layout property `flex-direction`. It is well-supported in modern browsers, but older versions may not fully support it.
3. Check other CSS rules: Ensure that there are no conflicting styles that may be overriding or interfering with the `flex-direction` property.
